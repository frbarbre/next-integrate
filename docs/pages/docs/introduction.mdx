# Introduction

First of all, thank you for checking out Next Integrate.\
I firmly believe it has a place in the plethora of authentication libraries in the Next.js ecosystem and i hope you do too.

### What sets the library apart?

The purpose of Next Integrate is to give the developer as much customizeability as possible. There is no built-in session management or other core features of a more conventional auth library. Next Integrate focuses solely, on making OAuth providers easy to set up and manage.
