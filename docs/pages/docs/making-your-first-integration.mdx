# Making your first integration

After finishing the [Getting Started](./getting-started.mdx) guide, you are now ready to move on. In this guide, i'll will walk you through the process of creating your first integration.

As an example we'll create an integration with Google, where we'll get the user's tokens.

<Steps>
### Set redirect URI and retrieve Client ID and Client Secret

First you'll have to create a new project in the [Google Developer Console](https://cloud.google.com/), and create a new OAuth application. If you don't know how to do this, you can follow [Google's guide](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en).

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You'll have to set yourself as a test user in the OAuth consent screen, to be
  able to test the OAuth flow. Without this, you'll get an error when trying to
  authenticate.
</Callout>

When you have created the project, you'll have to set the redirect URI to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/integration/google`. This insures that the OAuth flow will redirect back to your application.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If you've set a [custom base path](/docs/guides/configure-custom-basepath),
  you'll have to change the redirect URI to match the new path. Example:
  `http://localhost:3000/something/api/auth/integration/google`.
</Callout>

Once you've finished setting up the OAuth application, you'll get a `Client ID` and `Client Secret`. You'll have to save these for the next step.

### Setup `.env` variables

After you've gotten the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, you'll have to add them to your `.env.local` file:

<Callout emoji="💡">
  The naming the of the variables is not important. You can name them whatever
  you want, as long as you use the same names in the next step.
</Callout>

```env copy filename=".env.local"
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=your-client-id
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

### Setting up the provider

Now go the the `auth.ts` file you created in the [Getting Started](./getting-started.mdx) guide, and add the following code:

```ts copy filename="auth.ts" {11-16}
import { NextIntegrate } from 'next-integrate';

export const { auth } = NextIntegrate({
  // The URL of the app, e.g. https://example.com, set in the .env file.
  // If you want to modify the redirect URL, to be prefixed with something else,
  // you can do it here like this:
  // base_url: process.env.BASE_URL! + "/some-prefix",
  // This will change the redirect URL to eg. https://example.com/some-prefix/api/auth/integration/google
  base_url: process.env.BASE_URL!,
  providers: [
    {
      provider: 'google',
      client_id: process.env.AUTH_GOOGLE_ID!,
      client_secret: process.env.AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET!,
      integrations: [],
    },
  ],
});
```

This will add the Google provider to the `auth` object. The `integrations` array is empty, but we'll add the integrations in the next step.

### Adding an integration

Now we'll add the integrations to the `auth` object. We'll add an integration, we´ll give it a `name`, and set some `scopes` that we want to get from the user. The `options` are different for each provider, so you'll have to check the provider's documentation to see what options are available (see [Google's options](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#creatingclient)).

```ts copy filename="auth.ts" {16-24}
import { NextIntegrate } from 'next-integrate';

export const { auth } = NextIntegrate({
  // The URL of the app, e.g. https://example.com, set in the .env file.
  // If you want to modify the redirect URL, to be prefixed with something else,
  // you can do it here like this:
  // base_url: process.env.BASE_URL! + "/some-prefix",
  // This will change the redirect URL to eg. https://example.com/some-prefix/api/auth/integration/google
  base_url: process.env.BASE_URL!,
  providers: [
    {
      provider: 'google',
      client_id: process.env.AUTH_GOOGLE_ID!,
      client_secret: process.env.AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET!,
      integrations: [
        {
          name: 'user_info',
          options: {
            scope: 'openid https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile',
          },
          callback: async (data) => {
            // This is where you can save the data to a database, or do something else with it.
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

### Using the `callback()` function

After the user has authenticated, the `callback()` function will be called. This is where you can save the data to a database, set a cookie, or do something else with the data.

```ts copy filename="auth.ts" {2, 22-24}
import { NextIntegrate } from 'next-integrate';
import { cookies } from 'next/headers';

export const { auth } = NextIntegrate({
  // The URL of the app, e.g. https://example.com, set in the .env file.
  // If you want to modify the redirect URL, to be prefixed with something else,
  // you can do it here like this:
  // base_url: process.env.BASE_URL! + "/some-prefix",
  // This will change the redirect URL to eg. https://example.com/some-prefix/api/auth/integration/google
  base_url: process.env.BASE_URL!,
  providers: [
    {
      provider: 'google',
      client_id: process.env.AUTH_GOOGLE_ID!,
      client_secret: process.env.AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET!,
      integrations: [
        {
          name: 'user_info',
          options: {
            scope: 'openid https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile',
          },
          callback: async (data) => {
            cookies().set('session', JSON.stringify(data));
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

### Make an integration button

Now you can make a button that will trigger the OAuth flow. You can use the `<Integrate />` component to do this (you can find the component in the [Getting Started guide](/docs/getting-started#create-an-integrate-components)).

The `provider` prop is the name of the provider you want to integrate with, and the `name` prop is the name of integration you want the button to trigger, in this case the name will be `user_info`.

<Callout emoji={'💡'}>
  You can also use the `redirect` props to redirect the user to a specific URL
  after completing the OAuth flow.
</Callout>

```tsx copy {1, 6-8}
import Integrate from '@/components/integrate';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <Integrate provider="google" name="user_info">
        Get Google User Info
      </Integrate>
    </main>
  );
}
```

### Boom you're done!

If you've followed all the steps, you should now have a working integration with Google. This is just the beginning, and you can now start to build your own integrations with the most popular OAuth providers.

You can test out the OAuth flow below, and see the user data that is returned (your data is only being stored in a cookie and are **not** being sent anywhere else).

<Integrate
  name="user_info"
  provider={'google'}
  redirect={'/docs/making-your-first-integration#boom-youre-done'}
  className={buttonVariants({
    className: 'mt-6',
    variant: 'outline',
  })}
>
  <Image
    src={'/icons/google.svg'}
    width={16}
    height={16}
    alt="Google Logo"
    className="mr-2"
  />
  <span>Google OAuth</span>
</Integrate>

<UserData />

</Steps>

import { useData } from 'nextra/data';
import cookie from 'cookie';

export const getServerSideProps = (context) => {
  const cookies = context.req.headers.cookie;
  const parsedCookies = cookies ? cookie.parse(cookies) : {};
  const googleUserInfo = parsedCookies.google_user_info || "{}";

return {
props: {
ssg: {
cookies: {
googleUserInfo,
},
},
},
};
};

export const UserData = () => {
  // Get the data from SSG, and render it as a component.
  const { cookies } = useData();
  return (
    <>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(cookies.googleUserInfo), null, 2)}</pre>
    </>
  );
};
